            <h1>POKEMON</h1>
            <p><i>Pokémon</i> is a multi-media franchise that's owned and developed by the major Japanese games manufacturer, Nintendo. It is second only to the company's Mario Brothers franchise in terms of profitability — making it the world's second most lucrative video game franchise. Pokémon gets its fan base hooked on creature collection — to complete what's called the Pokédex — in order to achieve various goals and to improve their combat abilities. The franchise exists as several video games, a trading card game, televised anime, manga, and even theatrical films.</p>

                <p>The match-three puzzle game is free on both platforms with in-game purchases available.</p>

                <p>    In <i>Pokemon Shuffle</i>, players deal damage against wild Pokemon by matching three or more Pokemon in a row. Players will clear stages by using Mega-Evolved Pokemon, levelling up their own Pokemon, and matching types with wild Pokemon; any wild Pokemon that are defeated can be caught. There are currently over 150 Pokemon available.
                    Pokemon Shuffle was first released for 3DS earlier this year, earning some 4 million downloads by mid-year. Pokemon Shuffle Mobile was announced in June.</p>
